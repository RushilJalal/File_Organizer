# File_Organizer

The File Organizer is an automated system designed to streamline the process of sorting and organizing files based on their type, such as images and videos. By leveraging the watchdog library, it monitors changes in a specified directory in real-time and automatically moves files to your desired locations.

## Key Features
Automated Sorting:
The system sorts files into categories based on their extensions, such as images and videos.

## Real-Time Monitoring: ##
The watchdog library tracks changes in the monitored directory, ensuring files are sorted and moved as soon as they are added.

## Customizable Directories: ##
Users can specify the source directory to monitor and the destination directories for different file types.

## File Conflict Resolution: ##
If a file with the same name already exists in the destination directory, the system renames the new file to prevent overwriting.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility: ##
The script is designed to work on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
